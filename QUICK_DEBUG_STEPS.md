# üîç Quick Debug Steps - Let's Fix This Now!

## üö® I've Added Your URL Directly in the Code

I've temporarily hardcoded your Google Apps Script URL in the code so it should work immediately:

```
https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbyJlgIWIaYVhJvxelpg6wOX4FaFz_LUe7W08vFG8e5kR8KMyEbj9wJKDmzgd3yPtSUV/exec
```

## üß™ Test Steps

### 1. **Deploy the Updated Code**
- The new build includes your URL hardcoded
- It should work immediately now

### 2. **Test the Form**
- Submit a form with the access code 'IVA98'
- Check browser console for debug messages
- You should see: "GoogleDriveService initialized" and "Using webAppUrl: https://script.google.com/..."

### 3. **Check Google Apps Script Logs**
- Go to [script.google.com](https://script.google.com)
- Open your "ProHappy Forms Handler" project
- Click "Executions" on the left
- You should see execution logs when forms are submitted

## üîß If It Still Doesn't Work

### Check Your Google Apps Script:

1. **Make sure it's deployed correctly**:
   - Go to your script
   - Click "Deploy" ‚Üí "Manage deployments"
   - Make sure "Execute as" is "Me"
   - Make sure "Who has access" is "Anyone"

2. **Test the script directly**:
   - Copy this test data:
   ```json
   {
     "formType": "assignment",
     "fullName": "Test User",
     "email": "test@example.com",
     "moduleName": "Test Module",
     "wordCount": 1000,
     "orderDeadline": "2025-02-15",
     "guidance": "Test guidance",
     "accessCode": "IVA98",
     "files": []
   }
   ```
   - Use a tool like Postman or curl to POST this to your script URL
   - Check if it adds a row to your Google Sheet

3. **Check permissions**:
   - Make sure your Google Apps Script has access to:
     - Your Google Drive folders
     - Your Google Spreadsheet

## üéØ Debug Information

When you submit a form, check the browser console. You should see:

```
GoogleDriveService initialized
Using webAppUrl: https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbyJlgIWIaYVhJvxelpg6wOX4FaFz_LUe7W08vFG8e5kR8KMyEbj9wJKDmzgd3yPtSUV/exec
Submitting assignment form to Google Apps Script...
Sending 0 files to Google Apps Script
Google Apps Script success: { success: true, message: "Form submitted successfully!", filesUploaded: 0 }
```

## üöÄ This Should Work Now!

The URL is hardcoded in the code, so environment variable issues won't matter. Deploy and test - it should work immediately!

If you still get errors, check the Google Apps Script execution logs to see what's happening on the Google side."
