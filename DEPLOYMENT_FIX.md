# 🔧 Deployment Fix Applied

## Problem Solved ✅

The deployment was failing because:
1. **Coolify was using Nixpacks** instead of your Dockerfile
2. **Playwright postinstall script** was trying to install system dependencies that conflicted with Nix environment

## Fixes Applied 🛠️

### 1. Force Dockerfile Usage
- Created `.coolify` file with `buildpack=dockerfile`
- This tells Coolify to use your Dockerfile instead of auto-detecting Nixpacks

### 2. Skip Playwright in Production Build
- Modified Dockerfile to use `npm ci --ignore-scripts`
- This skips the `postinstall` script that installs Playwright (not needed for production)

### 3. Optimized Build Process
- Dockerfile now builds faster by skipping unnecessary dev dependencies
- Production build only includes what's needed to serve the static files

## Deploy Now! 🚀

1. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **In Coolify**:
   - Create new application
   - Connect your GitHub repo
   - Set Port: `80`
   - Set Health Check: `/health.json`
   - Click Deploy!

## Why This Works Now ✨

- ✅ **Dockerfile detected automatically** (thanks to `.coolify` file)
- ✅ **No Playwright conflicts** (skipped in production build)
- ✅ **Fast, clean build** (only production dependencies)
- ✅ **Nginx serves static files** (optimized for performance)
- ✅ **Health checks work** (monitoring ready)

Your app should deploy successfully now! 🎉
