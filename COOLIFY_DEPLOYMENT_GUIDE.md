## üîó Webhook Setup (n8n Integration)

### Required n8n Webhooks

You need to create these webhook endpoints in your n8n instance:

1. **Assignment Webhook**: `/webhook/assignment`
   - Method: POST
   - Handles new assignment requests

2. **Changes Webhook**: `/webhook/changes`
   - Method: POST
   - Handles change requests for existing orders

3. **Worker Webhook**: `/webhook/worker`
   - Method: POST
   - Handles worker submissions

### Webhook Payload Structure

Each webhook receives JSON data in this format:
```json
{
  "formType": "assignment|changes|worker",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-31T12:00:00.000Z",
  "data": {
    // Form-specific data
  },
  "metadata": {
    "userAgent": "browser info",
    "timestamp": "timestamp",
    "formVersion": "1.0.0"
  }
}
```

See `WEBHOOK_CONFIGURATION.md` for detailed payload structures.
