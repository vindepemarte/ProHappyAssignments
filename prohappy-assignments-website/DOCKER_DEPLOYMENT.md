# 🐳 Docker Deployment Guide for Coolify

## 🚀 Ready for Docker Deployment!

Your ProHappyAssignments website is now configured for bulletproof Docker deployment through Coolify.

## 📁 Docker Files Created

- ✅ `Dockerfile` - Multi-stage build with Nginx
- ✅ `docker-compose.yml` - Complete orchestration setup
- ✅ `nginx.conf` - Optimized Nginx configuration
- ✅ `.env.docker` - Environment variables template
- ✅ `.dockerignore` - Optimized build context

## 🔧 Coolify Docker Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Choose Docker Deployment in Coolify

1. **Go to your Coolify dashboard**
2. **Click "New Application"**
3. **Select "Git Repository"** 
4. **Choose your GitHub repository**
5. **Select "Dockerfile" as Build Pack**

### Step 2: Configure Docker Settings

```yaml
# Repository Settings
Repository: your-username/your-repo-name
Branch: main
Root Directory: prohappy-assignments-website

# Docker Settings
Dockerfile Path: ./Dockerfile
Build Context: ./
Port: 80
Health Check Path: /health.json
```

### Step 3: Environment Variables

Add these in Coolify's environment variables section:

```env
VITE_ASSIGNMENT_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/assignment
VITE_CHANGES_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/changes
VITE_WORKER_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/worker
VITE_FILE_UPLOAD_MAX_SIZE=10485760
VITE_ENVIRONMENT=production
```

### Step 4: Deploy

1. **Click "Deploy"**
2. **Watch Docker build logs**
3. **Your site will be live on port 80**

## 🏗️ Docker Architecture

### Multi-Stage Build Process

1. **Builder Stage (Node.js 20 Alpine)**
   - Installs dependencies with `npm ci`
   - Builds production assets with `npm run build:production`
   - Optimizes for minimal build time

2. **Production Stage (Nginx Alpine)**
   - Lightweight Nginx server
   - Serves static files from `/usr/share/nginx/html`
   - Includes health checks and security headers
   - Gzip compression enabled

### Container Features

- ✅ **Health Checks**: `/health.json` endpoint
- ✅ **Security Headers**: XSS, CSRF, Content-Type protection
- ✅ **Gzip Compression**: Reduces bandwidth usage
- ✅ **Static Asset Caching**: 1-year cache for assets
- ✅ **SPA Routing**: Proper React Router support
- ✅ **File Upload Support**: 15MB max file size

## 🔍 Testing Your Docker Deployment

### Local Testing (Optional)

```bash
# Build and run locally to test
cd prohappy-assignments-website
docker build -t prohappy-assignments .
docker run -p 8080:80 prohappy-assignments

# Test health check
curl http://localhost:8080/health.json
```

### Production Testing

Once deployed in Coolify:

```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://your-domain.com/health.json

# Should return:
# {"status":"healthy","timestamp":"2025-01-31T..."}
```

## 🛡️ Security Features

### Nginx Security Headers

- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME sniffing
- **X-XSS-Protection**: XSS attack protection
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls referrer information
- **Content-Security-Policy**: Prevents code injection

### File Access Protection

- Hidden files (`.env`, `.git`) blocked
- Backup files (`.bak`, `.swp`) blocked
- Only serves built static assets

## 📊 Performance Optimizations

### Caching Strategy

- **Static Assets**: 1-year cache (immutable)
- **HTML Files**: No cache (always fresh)
- **Manifest Files**: 1-day cache
- **API Responses**: No cache

### Compression

- **Gzip enabled** for all text-based files
- **Compression level 6** (balanced speed/size)
- **Minimum 1KB** file size for compression

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Docker Issues

1. **Build Fails**
   ```bash
   # Check if files exist in repository
   ls -la prohappy-assignments-website/
   
   # Verify Dockerfile syntax
   docker build --no-cache -t test .
   ```

2. **Container Won't Start**
   ```bash
   # Check container logs
   docker logs container-name
   
   # Test health check
   curl http://localhost/health.json
   ```

3. **Environment Variables Not Working**
   - Ensure variables are set in Coolify dashboard
   - Variables must start with `VITE_` for Vite builds
   - Check build logs for environment variable loading

### Health Check Debugging

```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl -v http://your-domain/health.json

# Expected response:
# HTTP/1.1 200 OK
# Content-Type: application/json
# {"status":"healthy","timestamp":"..."}
```

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment

- [ ] Code pushed to GitHub repository
- [ ] Dockerfile exists in `prohappy-assignments-website/`
- [ ] Environment variables prepared
- [ ] Domain configured in Coolify

### During Deployment

- [ ] Docker build completes successfully
- [ ] Container starts without errors
- [ ] Health check passes
- [ ] Website loads correctly

### Post-Deployment

- [ ] Test all three forms (Assignment, Changes, Worker)
- [ ] Verify webhook integration works
- [ ] Test file uploads
- [ ] Check mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Verify SSL certificate

## 🎯 Why This Docker Setup is Bulletproof

### Reliability
