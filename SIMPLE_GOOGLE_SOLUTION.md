# 🎯 Simple Google Drive + Sheets Solution - DONE!

## ✅ What I've Built For You

A **much simpler solution** that does exactly what you want:

1. **📁 Upload files directly to Google Drive** (in folders you choose)
2. **📊 Add row to your Google Sheet** with all form data + file URLs  
3. **🔄 Your existing n8n workflow triggers automatically** (no changes needed!)

## 🚀 How It Works Now

### **When Someone Submits a Form:**

1. **Files Upload** → Your Google Drive folders:
   - Assignment files → "ProHappy - Assignment Files" folder
   - Changes files → "ProHappy - Changes Files" folder  
   - Worker files → "ProHappy - Worker Files" folder

2. **Get File URLs** → `https://drive.google.com/open?id=FILE_ID`

3. **Add Row to Sheet** → Your existing spreadsheet with:
   ```
   Timestamp | Order Deadline | Full Name | Module Name | Word Count | Assignment Files | Email | Guidance | Access Code
   31/07/2025 19:49:28 | 01/08/2025 | John Doe | CS101 | 5000 | https://drive.google.com/open?id=ABC123, https://drive.google.com/open?id=DEF456 | john@example.com | Focus on theory | JD001
   ```

4. **n8n Triggers** → Your existing workflow runs automatically!
